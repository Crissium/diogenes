<h2>Entering Greek Words</h2>

<p>At the moment, most browsers do not support in a consistent way
the entering of polytonic Greek text into <small>HTML</small> 
fill-in forms.  It is therefore
necessary to type in Greek words via some scheme of Latin
transliteration.  Diogenes supports two such schemes.  

<h3>Perseus style</h3><a target="Perseus">
<p>
The normal and more permissive method is similar to the transliteration
adopted by the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus
Project</a>.  In this scheme, you should not indicate accents or upper-case
letters in the words you are searching for; consonants are rendered by
their phonetic equivalent; and eta and omega are distinguished from
epsilon and omicron by the use of a circumflex accent (&ecirc;,
&ocirc;) if your keyboard can manage them, or by placing a caret after
the vowel (e^, o^).  Rough and smooth breathings are distinguished;
put "h" in front of a word to indicate a rough breathing.  The absence of an "h"
implies the absence of a rough breathing, rather than the presence of a smooth
breathing.
</p><p>
You may use a limited subset of Perl regular expressions in your input;
see <a href="#regexp">below</a>.

</p><p>
Thus a search for the hero Herakles would be
performed by entering the word "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakle^s&nbsp;</tt>" for the nominative case
only, or "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakl</tt>" to add the oblique cases (note the
leading and trailing spaces to indicate the start and end of a word).
</p>

<h3>BETA code</h3>

<p>
If you prefer to stipulate your searches more precisely, you may
work with the transliteration employed natively by the
<i>TLG</i>, the so-called BETA code. 
</p>
<p>
In this scheme, you <b>must</b> indicate accents and breathings in the
normalized form used by the <i>TLG</i> word list: do not indicate
upper-case letters, and do not use barytone accents.  You may use
lower-case Latin letters.
Thus the Attic nominative singular of Herakles would be
"<tt>&nbsp;h(raklh=s&nbsp;</tt>", and the oblique and variant forms would be found with
"<tt>&nbsp;h(rakl</tt>".
Remember that words appearing in all upper-case Greek will not usually
have dicritics, so to pick up titles, etc., you will also need to try
"<tt>&nbsp;hraklhs&nbsp;</tt>" (note the leading and trailing spaces to indicate the start and end
of a word).   You may not use Perl regular expression metacharacters,
because many of them are significant in Beta code; your pattern will be
turned into a regular expression that allows hyphenation to intervene.

</p>

<h3>Character maps</h3>
<p>
Here are the full details of the two transliteration schemes:

<h3>Usage hints<a name="regexp"></a></h3>

<p>
For both Latin and Greek searches, your search term is turned into a
pattern that ignores distinctions between upper and lower case, and
which permits the hypenation and the indexing and formatting codes that
are used in the databases to intervene.  In the case of Latin, w and v
and i and j are treated as equivalent.


<p>
When constructing a search pattern, you may include spaces at the
beginning, at the end, or in the middle of your pattern in order to
indicate a word boundary.  Thus the pattern <tt>"et"</tt> would find a
match in the words <i>aetas</i>, <i>etiam</i>, <i>scilicet</i> and of
course <i>et</i>, whereas <tt>"&nbsp;et"</tt> would only match in the
words <i>etiam</i> and <i>et</i>.  Likewise, <tt>"et&nbsp;"</tt> would
match in <i>scilicet</i> and <i>et</i>, and if you entered the pattern
<tt>"&nbsp;et&nbsp;"</tt>, you would match only the word <i>et</i>.


<p>
The way in which this is accomplished is by turning your pattern into a
more complex pattern called a "regular expression", a notation that
permits the stipulation of highly complex patterns.  Diogenes permits
you to use certain aspects of the Perl regular expression syntax in
combination with the Perseus-style transliteration.  Some of the
features that you may wish to use are (NB. These are not available if
you are using Beta-style input for Greek searches):
</p>
<dl>
 <dt><tt>[abcd]</tt></dt>
 <dd>Square brackets mean: "match any one (and only one) of the enclosed letters".</dd>
 <p>
 <dt><tt>(quid)</tt></dt>
 <dd>Round parentheses mean: "match everything enclosed herein or nothing at
 all".</dd>
 <p>
 <dt><tt>h(ic)|(aec)|(oc)</tt></dt>
 <dd>The vertical bar between expressions (a|b|c) means: "match 
 a or b or c ..., but only one of these". So [abc], defined above, is
 just a shorthand for (a|b|c).  </dd>
 <p>
 <dt><tt>?</tt></dt>
 <dd>The question mark means that matching the preceeding expression is
 optional: the match will include it if present, but will not fail in
 its absence. Thus "<tt>hae?c</tt>" will match haec or hac.</dd>
 <p>
 <dt>*</dt>
 <dd>The asterisk means: "Match the preceeding expression if it occurs
 for as many times as it repeats, but do not fail in its absence". Note
 that this is a very different meaning to the use of the asterisk as a
 "wild card" character.  So the pattern "<tt>et</tt>" will match both "et" and
 "etiam": there is no need to write "<tt>et*</tt>".  In fact,
 "<tt>et*</tt>" will match
 "et" and "etttttt", which is probably not what you want. </dd>
 <dt>+</dt>
 <dd>The plus sign is just like the asterisk, except that at least one
 of the preceeding expression must be present in order to match.  Thus
 a+ is just shorthand for aa*.</dd>
 <p>
</dl>

<p>
Note that Diogenes performs its own transformation of your input, so the
full range of Perl regular expressions is not available to those who use
the Perseus-style input, but what is available should be sufficient for
many uses.

<p>
There is no space here for an extensive description of regular
expressions, but for a sense of their flexibility, consider the
following pattern:
</p>

<p><tt>" re(x|g(is?(bus)?|e[ms]?|um)) "</tt></p>

<p>
This pattern matches the word "rex" in all of its cases while ignoring
other related words (regnum, regina, etc.).  Note that the pattern
begins and ends with a space, which means that the match must begin and
end on a word boundary.  The pattern then stipulates that the beginning
word boundary must be followed by the letters "r" and "e", and that
this must be followed by a complex parenthesized sub-expression that defines
the rest of the word.  This breaks down into: "Either the letter "x", or
the letter "g" if it is followed in turn by another nested sub-expression in
round parentheses. What must follow the "g" is defined as "Either the
letter "i", followed optionally by the letter "s" or the letters "bus";
or the letter "e", followed optionally by either the letter "m" or "s"
(but not both), or by the letters "um".

<p>In this way, you can define searches quite narrowly, while not
worrying about hyphenated words, upper and lower case, or
in the case of Greek, accentuation.

<h3><i>TLG</i> word list</h3>

<p>
If you choose to search via the <i>TLG</I> word list, note that it is
indexed by the first two characters of every word, so that if you look
for "<tt>agathos</tt>", you may not get "kagathos".  Set the option 
<tt>use_tlgwlinx</tt> to <tt>0</tt> to do a more comprehensive, but slower
search of the word list.
</p><p>
As with normal search terms, but a space in front of your query if you are only
interested in words beginning with those letters.
