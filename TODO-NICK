Suetonius bibliographical references are incorrectly handled, resulting in an invalid jump
	perseus seem to have changed their referencing of him, from: Perseus:abo:phi,1348,001:life=gal.:16 to: urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.phi017:16
	therefore need to add a mapping, either to the jumpTo part of diogenes or just in perseus-abo.pl.
	there may be other authors for whom this applies; ask Perseus / look for other 'strange' patterns in the original urns that may have been changed
see BUG in diogenes-browser/perl/Diogenes/Browser.pm
add a .desktop entry for linux
think about how best to enable installation on linux systems; will work from the directory, but ideally the diogenes script could be told a location it was installed to, so it could be elsewhere
add make install rule to install onto unix-like systems into system folders (so the diogenes-linux64 is an alternative, precompiled version, for people to stick on /opt or home, compared to this which is more for sysadmins / packagers)
add contributions / thanks prominently to diogenes
Menu needs populating
see github issues
it's easy to get perl warnings from diogenes; use it a bit and fix what's found
make settings page shorter and clearer - probably just a variant of firstrun page
consider changing the homepage interface so the 'what do you want to do' combobox is split out into a more sensible design
remove chrome/ dir and rename diogenes-browser/ to server/ or similar
headword in word lookup used to include macrons etc. probably don't want that now, but would be good to check with Peter what's most desirable.
try to restart diogenes-server if it is killed
