2 windows open in windows & linux now, since changing the watch rules for osx. actually doesn't seem to happen for windows (at least not reliably)
need to ensure osx build uses new icon too - have asked peter
lots more for the make clean rule
build to package.nw, to simplify and unify the mac / windows / linux packaging around that
Menus - copy, paste, find, back / forward, search (maybe) [see Diogenes.xul for inspiration]
process.on('exit') not triggered on linux, either killing nwjs or quitting the application from the menu
add tabs - https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/242
Document better where the data should go from -prebuilt repo
Clean up diogenes-startup.js, removing commented out tests etc.
Use a fancy font (linux-libertine or junicode, maybe)
Disable proxy for localhost, if possible
