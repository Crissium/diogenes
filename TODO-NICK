# TODO

Add contributions / thanks prominently to diogenes

Make settings page shorter and clearer - roughly a variant of firstrun page, but ensure that it still works outside of electron

Suetonius bibliographical references are incorrectly handled, resulting in an invalid jump
	perseus seem to have changed their referencing of him, from: Perseus:abo:phi,1348,001:life=gal.:16 to: urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.phi017:16
	therefore need to add a mapping, either to the jumpTo part of diogenes or just in perseus-abo.pl.
	there may be other authors for whom this applies; ask Perseus / look for other 'strange' patterns in the original urns that may have been changed
	wait until helma's LSJ is integrated, to ensure we aren't doing unnecessary work here

See BUG in diogenes-browser/perl/Diogenes/Browser.pm - an invalid jump address can cause the diogenes server to crash

Add title of work back to poem reader (it used to be there); see http://localhost:8889/Diogenes.cgi?JumpTo=phi%2C1348%2C001%3Alife%3Dgal.%3A10&FontName=&actionXXstate=lookup&greek_output_formatXXstate=UTF-8&JumpToXXstate=&typeXXstate=TLG+Texts&goXXstate=Go&current_pageXXstate=lookup&short_typeXXstate=tlg&queryXXstate=sacramentum&FontNameXXstate=&corpusXXstate=TLG+Texts

Update README to mention that latex output, the dio command line tool, and (maybe) other bits are still about, but haven't received much focus, so may not be as solid as the rest

Next & Prev pop up rather than switch page in dictionary lookup


# Maybe TODO

headword in word lookup used to include macrons etc. probably don't want that now, but would be good to check with Peter what's most desirable.

try to restart diogenes-server if it is killed

consider changing the homepage interface so the 'what do you want to do' combobox is split out into a more sensible design

it's easy to get perl warnings from diogenes; use it a bit and fix what's found
