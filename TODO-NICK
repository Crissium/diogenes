If main window is closed all other windows are closed
	hmmm. window-all-closed is sent when the main window is closed, even if others are still open. however even if it's prevented from running app.quit() the other windows are closed moments later.
	maybe they're child windows?
		doesn't seem to be, setting parent: false in main window, and using setParentWindow(null) for new windows, didn't make any difference
		double-checked with getChildWindows, def. not.
	this isn't true of windows created using the context menu new window option, only windows created with shift-click-ing on links
add app icons (for each platform)
hidpi options for other images diogenes serves, such as in the perseus popup
Menu needs populating
make dist should exist and do what all does

file -> quit doesn't work in further info page, browse page, does on context page... seems to be every other page; perseus-style (from further info) works. the loading event is only fired on this every other pages, too
	add web inspector opening so we can see the web console, to debug this. note that sdk version is now easily enable-able in makefile
	(working on this in local fixquit branch)
	the window never receives the 'close' signal when it fails.
	should count the number of open windows and if it's the last one, close the mainwin too - that is the correct way to kill the server. note that osx's "quit" event may need a special case in the code
add a loading indicator

2 windows open in windows & linux now, since changing the watch rules for osx. actually doesn't seem to happen for windows (at least not reliably)
need to ensure osx build uses new icon too - have asked peter
build to package.nw, to simplify and unify the mac / windows / linux packaging around that
Menus - copy, paste, find, back / forward, search (maybe) [see Diogenes.xul for inspiration]
process.on('exit') not triggered on linux, either killing nwjs or quitting the application from the menu
Menus - copy, paste, find, back / forward, search (maybe) [see Diogenes.xul for inspiration]

Document better where the data should go from -prebuilt repo
Use a fancy font (linux-libertine or junicode, maybe)

Clean up diogenes-startup.js, removing commented out tests etc.
Disable proxy for localhost, if possible
