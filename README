                             Installing Diogenes

NEW: The preferred way to install Diogenes under Unix is as a normal user,
running the CGI script from the command line.

It used to be the case that you had to install the web interface under
Apache, but that is not recommended anymore.  The Daemon.pl server
script is faster and uses less memory.

If you have an old Apache-based installation, you will have to remove it
before installing this version.


Run Setup.pl to generate a configuration file (called diogenes.ini
under MS Windows and .diogenesrc under Unix) in the current directory.

If the settings in this automatically generated file are not quite
right, change them by hand.  For example, you may have to specify where
your CD-Roms are located.

                                  * * *

Daemon.pl is a mini HTTP server that delivers the web interface.

diogenes is the command line interface: type diogenes -? for options.
