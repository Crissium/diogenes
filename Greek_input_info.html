      <h1>Typing Greek</h1>

<!--      
      <h2>Unicode</h2>

      <p>
        Unicode is now the standard means of digital representation of
        Ancient Greek.  Some computing platforms provide a built-in
        and easy to use keyboard for entering ancient Greek Unicode,
        notably Emacs, Mac OS X, and some Linux desktop environments.
        Others have less useful support, notably MS Windows; users of
        such platforms may need to install an add-on program to type
        Unicode Greek, or use one of the Latin transliteration schemes
        described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Unicode input (no accents, loose matching)</h3>

      <h3>Unicode input (with accents, strict matching)</h3>
      
      <h2>Latin Transliteration Schemes</h2>
<p>
  Not all users are in the position of being able to enter Unicode
  Greek text on their computer.  For such users, Diogenes supports two
  schemes for typing in Greek words via Latin transliteration.
</p>

-->
<h3>Perseus style (loose matching)</h3><a target="Perseus"/>
<p>
  The normal and more permissive method is similar to the
  transliteration adopted by the <a
  href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus Project</a>.  In this
  scheme, you should not indicate accents or upper-case letters in the
  words you are searching for; consonants are rendered by their
  phonetic equivalent; and eta and omega are distinguished from
  epsilon and omicron by the use of a circumflex accent (&ecirc;,
  &ocirc;) if your keyboard can manage them, or by placing a caret
  after the vowel (e^, o^).  Rough and smooth breathings are
  distinguished; put "h" in front of a word to indicate a rough
  breathing.  The absence of an "h" implies the absence of a rough
  breathing, rather than the presence of a smooth breathing.  </p><p>
  You may use a limited subset of Perl regular expressions in your
  input; see <a href="#regexp">below</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Thus a search for the hero Herakles would be performed by entering
  the word "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakle^s&nbsp;</tt>" for the nominative case
  only, or "<tt>&nbsp;he^rakl</tt>" to add the oblique cases (note the
  leading and trailing spaces to indicate the start and end of a
  word).
</p>

<h3>BETA code (strict matching)</h3>

<p>
  If you prefer to stipulate your searches more precisely, you may
  work with the transliteration employed natively by the <i>TLG</i>,
  the so-called BETA code.
</p>
<p>
  In this scheme, you <b>must</b> indicate accents and breathings in
  the normalized form used by the <i>TLG</i> word list: do not
  indicate upper-case letters, and do not use barytone accents.  You
  may use lower-case Latin letters.  Thus the Attic nominative
  singular of Herakles would be "<tt>&nbsp;h(raklh=s&nbsp;</tt>", and
  the oblique and variant forms would be found with
  "<tt>&nbsp;h(rakl</tt>".  Remember that words appearing in all
  upper-case Greek will not usually have dicritics, so to pick up
  titles, etc., you will also need to try
  "<tt>&nbsp;hraklhs&nbsp;</tt>" (note the leading and trailing spaces
  to indicate the start and end of a word).  You may not use Perl
  regular expression metacharacters, because many of them are
  significant in Beta code; your pattern will be turned into a regular
  expression that allows hyphenation to intervene.
