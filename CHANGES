Modification history:

v. 1.3.3 Fixed Suda browse bug.  This probably breaks browsing on some
   other text.  May have to use special cases for some texts.

v. 1.3.2 Fixed some minor bugs.

v. 1.3 Long-delayed bug-fix release.  The interface to the Perseus
   morphological parser must have changed at some point, because words
   with a chi, xi, or psi had broken.  Fixed handling of browsing of
   non-numerical targets (eg. biographies).  Fixed encoding of web
   pages, so cutting and pasting has a better chance of working.  A
   few other small fixes.  Began using Darcs for source
   control. (13-Jul-04)

v. 1.1 Fixed bug in handling of "h" in Perseus transliteration for TLG
   word-list input for words beginning with a non-dipthong series of
   vowels (reported by A. Griffiths.  As a consequence I decided
   to ignore "h" altogether.  I think that there is no robust way of
   specifying exactly what "h" means, particularly in wierd forms.  This
   is a noteworthy change of behavior.

   Fixed a bug in the handling of internal spaces in Latin search
   phrases.

v. 1.00 Why? It's been about a year since any serious bug has been
   reported, I haven't had time to do much with it this year, and I am
   not going to have much time in the near future. So let's call it
   "stable". Slight redesign of the splash page (suggested by Pablo
   Rodriguez), and a few minor bug fixes. 17-Sep-02.

v. 0.95 A few minor bug fixes. 03-Apr-2002.

v. 0.93 Added links to Perseus morphological tools, rudimentary Coptic
   support. (17.8.2001)

v. 0.92 Fixed big bug introduced in 0.90, where capitalized words were
   not found.

v. 0.91 Added jump to browser in context of search results. Made
   improvements in the way the word index data is read.

v. 0.9 Diogenes daemon web server; cleaned up CGI script. Read
   documentation on PHI file formats, and fixed browser to take
   advantage of block-end citation info in .idt files (didn't speed it
   up, though). Added Setup script and lots of Greek encodings. Improved
   Windows support (21.7.2001)

v. 0.8 Basic Windows port, mechanism for adding user-defined Greek
   encodings, Unicode utf8, html entities, WinGreek output. (28.6.00)

v. 0.7 Major redesign of module (inheritance, documentation).
   Added: multiple patterns, select_authors, support for the DDP
   and inscriptions disk. Removed legacy code derived from
   latex2html and changed license to GPL. Re-entrant code for
   mod_perl safety. (25.5.00)

v. 0.5: CGI script and latex/gif output added. Improvements to the text
   browser and implementation of CGI browser. First public distribution.
   (11.11.99)

v. 0.3: TLG word list parsing and searching added. Imperfect text
   browser added. Much tweaking of regexps to imitate the (sometimes
   frustratingly inconsistent) habits of what the word list chooses to
   consider a word. (18.10.99)

v. 0.2: Module and command-line script separated. Automatic generation
   of regular expressions and transliteration of Greek from Perseus
   format added.  (14.9.99)      

v. 0.1: A number of various ad hoc Perl scripts for doing brute force
   Latin searches put together in one script; support for Greek
   added. (22.8.99)
