Modification history:

v. 3.0.6 Enhanced corpus management to include duplicating, merging
   and deleting selected items.

v. 3.0.5 Fix bug where selected Greek output encoding is not
   respected.  Move back to embedding chosen font in HTML, as Mozilla
   on the Mac has problems respecting the default font.  Add author
   numbers in the author browser for homonymous authors.

v. 3.0.4 Perseus doesn't like smooth breathings.  Fixed bug in line
   numbers in text browser for texts with only line numbers and no
   higher levels.

v. 3.0.3 Changed links to Perseus web site to include accents, as
   reportedly required due to a change in Perseus.

v. 3.0.2 Fixed gui bug in text browser for authors with single works

v. 3.0.1 Fixed bug in gui where multiple search did not respect
   user-defined corpora.  Fixed gui bug when defining a user-defined
   corpus without first specifying the location of the database.

v. 3.0 Another change of infrastructure.  Abandoned the
   platform-specific binary browsers used in version 2.0 in favor of
   the Mozilla (xulrunner) platform.  First public release of the
   changes made in version 2.1, along with further rewrite of the GUI,
   especially in handling user-defined corpora.

v. 2.1 Re-factored Diogenes.pm to break it into smaller modules, total
   re-write of Diogenes.cgi.  Added display of line numbers in the
   browser and we now show the desired passage at the center of the
   screen, instead of the top.  Never found time to release this
   version publicly.

v. 2.0 Essentially a pre-release of Diogenes version 2, with the
   old 1.4.3 Perl code mostly intact.  Big change is the new
   installation procedure for Mac and Windows, and addition of the
   dedicated binary browser on those platforms.  Also improved the
   installation procedure on Linux.  Setup.pl deprecated in favor of
   new diogenes-launcher.  Name of configuration file changed to
   diogenes.config.  New class method read_config_file.

v. 1.4.3 Alan Griffiths pointed out a regression where page-breaks
   surrounded by spaces interfered with phrase searches.

v. 1.4.2 Fixed bug reported by Bob Kaster, when giving multiple author
   patterns.

v. 1.4.1 Perl version 5.8.7 includes CGI.pm 3.10, which now makes
   xhtml the default, which in turn makes multipart forms the default,
   which Daemon.pl does not know how to deal with.  The result was 501
   errors.  Changed xhtml defualt to off and added (older) CGI.pm to
   CPAN directory in the hope of averting future surprises/

v. 1.4.0 Fixed bug (reported by P. Gainsford) in handling of
   Settings.cgi under Windows.  Now all cgi script are handled in the
   same way by daemon.pl.

   Added CPAN subdirectory, which is meant to include all necessary
   modules that do not come with the core distribution of Perl.  This
   is primarily intended to ease installation under OS X.

v. 1.3.4 Fixed bug (reported by A. Griffiths) where a pattern ending
   in a space would also grab a following asterisk off the next word.
   Noted missing glyph for iota diaresis in WinGreek.

v. 1.3.3 Fixed Suda browse bug.  This probably breaks browsing on some
   other text.  May have to use special cases for some texts.

v. 1.3.2 Fixed some minor bugs.

v. 1.3 Long-delayed bug-fix release.  The interface to the Perseus
   morphological parser must have changed at some point, because words
   with a chi, xi, or psi had broken.  Fixed handling of browsing of
   non-numerical targets (eg. biographies).  Fixed encoding of web
   pages, so cutting and pasting has a better chance of working.  A
   few other small fixes.  Began using Darcs for source
   control. (13-Jul-04)

v. 1.1 Fixed bug in handling of "h" in Perseus transliteration for TLG
   word-list input for words beginning with a non-dipthong series of
   vowels (reported by A. Griffiths.  As a consequence I decided
   to ignore "h" altogether.  I think that there is no robust way of
   specifying exactly what "h" means, particularly in wierd forms.  This
   is a noteworthy change of behavior.

   Fixed a bug in the handling of internal spaces in Latin search
   phrases.

v. 1.00 Why? It's been about a year since any serious bug has been
   reported, I haven't had time to do much with it this year, and I am
   not going to have much time in the near future. So let's call it
   "stable". Slight redesign of the splash page (suggested by Pablo
   Rodriguez), and a few minor bug fixes. 17-Sep-02.

v. 0.95 A few minor bug fixes. 03-Apr-2002.

v. 0.93 Added links to Perseus morphological tools, rudimentary Coptic
   support. (17.8.2001)

v. 0.92 Fixed big bug introduced in 0.90, where capitalized words were
   not found.

v. 0.91 Added jump to browser in context of search results. Made
   improvements in the way the word index data is read.

v. 0.9 Diogenes daemon web server; cleaned up CGI script. Read
   documentation on PHI file formats, and fixed browser to take
   advantage of block-end citation info in .idt files (didn't speed it
   up, though). Added Setup script and lots of Greek encodings. Improved
   Windows support (21.7.2001)

v. 0.8 Basic Windows port, mechanism for adding user-defined Greek
   encodings, Unicode utf8, html entities, WinGreek output. (28.6.00)

v. 0.7 Major redesign of module (inheritance, documentation).
   Added: multiple patterns, select_authors, support for the DDP
   and inscriptions disk. Removed legacy code derived from
   latex2html and changed license to GPL. Re-entrant code for
   mod_perl safety. (25.5.00)

v. 0.5: CGI script and latex/gif output added. Improvements to the text
   browser and implementation of CGI browser. First public distribution.
   (11.11.99)

v. 0.3: TLG word list parsing and searching added. Imperfect text
   browser added. Much tweaking of regexps to imitate the (sometimes
   frustratingly inconsistent) habits of what the word list chooses to
   consider a word. (18.10.99)

v. 0.2: Module and command-line script separated. Automatic generation
   of regular expressions and transliteration of Greek from Perseus
   format added.  (14.9.99)      

v. 0.1: A number of various ad hoc Perl scripts for doing brute force
   Latin searches put together in one script; support for Greek
   added. (22.8.99)
